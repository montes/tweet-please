Wordpress Plugin: Tweet Please
==============================
Tweet Please is a plugin that let's you have auto-tweeted all your new posts (you can select between send inmediately
after posted, after n hours, at next 8pm...)

I was "forced" to write it because I was unable to find one that worked well and was free.

To send tweets this plugin uses Codebird: https://github.com/jublonet/codebird-php
